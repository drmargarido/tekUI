The scope of the current (alpha) release was determined by the
smallest reasonable range of features needed for writing simple
everyday applications. Chances are that the following issues need to
be worked on:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== General ===

 * Bitmap graphics
 * Clipboard support
 * Context menus
 * Bubble help
 * FloatText styling options
 * Confinement of popup elements to the visible screen
 * The TextInput gadget is quite unsatisfactory

=== Known bugs ===

 * potential memory leak in visual.drawimage
 * Antialiased fonts unsupported under X11 with Composite Extension
 * Doubleclick timeout is incorrectly handled when using an
 integer version of Lua
