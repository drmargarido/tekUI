» Alignment attributes determine how elements are adjusted if they do not fill up the space inside their group on a given axis.

» The upper group is of a vertical orientation, and the elements have different horizontal alignments.

» The lower group is of a horizontal orientation, and the elements have different vertical alignments.

» The difference may become more apparent when the window is getting resized.

ANIMATIONS_DESCRIPTION = [[
» tekUI supports an interval timer, which any GUI element can attach itself to. 

» It provides a stable timer event source, which can be used for animated classes, multimedia controls and smooth animations.

» The timer interval is initiated by the first element that requests it. tekUI is strictly event-driven and consumes zero CPU time when idle.

» In this example, a network input class was derived from the input class with special behavior for entering IP numbers.

» The keypad buttons are descendants of the Text class, inserting their respective keyboard event into the window's message queue. 

» The keypad as a whole is a compound class descending from the Group class.
